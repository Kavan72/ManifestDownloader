# ManifestDownloader
Commandline tool to download manifest files, parse them and download their content.

This tool should be able to download all files for League of Legends, Legends of Runeterra, Valorant and all games to come that use these manifest files.

To download an optimized compiled executable, head on over to https://github.com/Morilli/ManifestDownloader/releases and download the most recent release.

To build it yourself, you'll need general C build tools (make, gcc).
Linux systems and mingw should be able to compile perfectly, everything else I don't really know tbh.
Just run "make" in the project root and the executable should be built automatically.
